# AtvSim

## Project Overview

This project aims to elevate the performance of LNCT's Society of Automotive Engineer's (SAE) ATV through the implementation of a telemetry system. Leveraging an MPU9250 sensor, an ESP32 board, and Arduino for wireless data transmission, the project integrates seamlessly with Unity for real-time data visualization.

## Key Features

### Telemetry System Design

- **Hardware:** Utilized MPU9250 sensor and ESP32 board for robust telemetry data collection.
  
- **Wireless Data Transmission:** Established wireless communication to a local PC using Arduino and the WebSockets protocol.

- **Real-time Data Fetching:** Implemented Python APIs for seamless integration with Unity's C# script or any third-party integrations.

### Data Analysis and Visualization

- **Python Scripting:** Created a Python script using Matplotlib for real-time data analysis, providing valuable insights into the telemetry data.

- **Integration with Unity:** Improved testing sessions by enabling the ATV's animated CAD model to respond to real-time sensor data, simulating real-life movements using Unity and C#.

### Upcoming Developments

- **Frontend Dashboard:** In the pipeline is the development of a frontend dashboard to offer a user-friendly interface for monitoring and analyzing telemetry data.

- **Real-Time Data Logging System:** Future plans include implementing a Python system that feeds data in real-time into a database and Excel sheets every time a session is activated, ensuring comprehensive and organized data logging.

### Comprehensive Project Scope

- **Hardware-Software Integration:** Successfully combined hardware integration, software development, and 3D modeling within a single project.

- **Technology Stack:** Python, Flask, Matplotlib, C#, Arduino.
